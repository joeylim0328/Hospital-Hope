# Hospital-Hope
Hospital-Hope is a hospital management system. This management system helps to digitalize the management of the hospital so that everything is more organized. The hospital management system will have three major features, namely making an appointment, view doctor's directory and making an enquiry all with the use of a chatbot. Our main objective is to reduce the long queue of patients in the hospital regardless of their purpose. This system is going to solve this by allowing users to queue virtually. Not only that, by saving the patients' records in a database, it is easy for the hospital staffs to trace the records. In this system, a chatbot is created to assist the patients if they need immediate feedback.
